SerenadeMe
OSX users only 
Plug in whatever song lyric you want into lyrics.txt
Then run serenade.py
looking for a web service for fetching lyrics on demand
Make sure the lyrics are line by line and there is no empty row
Note: The weird apostrophe's in a lot of rap lyrics will throw "unexpected EOF while looking for matching `'' " that will be ignored though
Please fork at will.
Thanks Happy singing.
