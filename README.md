# SerenadeMe
Make your MacBook sing your favorite song
* OSX users only 
* Plug in whatever song lyric you want into lyrics.txt
* Then run serenade.py
* looking for a web service for fetching lyrics on demand
* Make sure the lyrics are line by line and there is no empty row
* Note: The weird apostrophe's in a lot of rap lyrics will throw "unexpected EOF while looking for matching `'' " that will be ignored though
* Please fork at will
* Thanks Happy singing
